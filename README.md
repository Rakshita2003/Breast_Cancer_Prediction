## Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

1.  According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of women each year and affecting countries at all levels of modernization.

2.  1 in 8 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime

3.  On average, every 2 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States.

4.  There are over 3.5 million breast cancer survivors in the United States

5.  Breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, except for skin cancers. It is estimated that in 2020, approximately 30% of all new women cancer diagnoses will be breast cancer.

## What Is Breast Cancer? 
Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. 

## Understanding Breast Cancer
Cancer is a broad term for a class of diseases characterized by abnormal cells that grow and invade  healthy cells in the body.  Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast as a group of cancer cells that can then invade surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body.

## What Causes Cancer To Develop?
Cancer begins in the cells which are the basic building blocks that make up tissue. Tissue is found in the breast and other parts of the body.  Sometimes, the process of cell growth goes wrong and new cells form when the body doesn’t need them and old or damaged cells do not die as they should.  When this occurs, a build up of cells often forms a mass of tissue called a lump, growth, or tumor.

Breast cancer occurs when malignant tumors develop in the breast.  These cells can spread by breaking away from the original tumor and entering blood vessels or lymph vessels, which branch into tissues throughout the body. When cancer cells travel to other parts of the body and begin damaging other tissues and organs, the process is called metastasis.


## Breast Cancer Symptoms and Signs
Many breast cancer symptoms are invisible and not noticeable without a professional screening, but some symptoms can be caught early just by being proactive about your breast health. 

- A Change In How The Breast Or Nipple Looks Or Feels
  - Nipple tenderness or a lump or thickening in or near the breast or underarm area
  - - A change in the skin texture or an enlargement of pores in the skin of the breast  (some describe this as similar to an orange peel’s texture)
  - A lump in the breast (It’s important to remember that all lumps should be investigated by a healthcare professional, but not all lumps are cancerous.)
- A Change In The Breast Or Nipple Appearance
  - Any unexplained change in the size or shape of the breast
  - Dimpling anywhere on the breast
  - Unexplained swelling of the breast (especially if on one side only)
  - Unexplained shrinkage of the breast (especially if on one side only)
  - Recent asymmetry (unequal or lack of sameness) of the breasts. Although it is common for women to have one breast that is slightly larger than the other, if the onset of asymmetry is recent, it should be checked.
  - Nipple that is turned slightly inward or inverted
  - Skin of the breast, areola, or nipple that becomes scaly, red, or swollen or may have ridges or pitting resembling the skin of an orange
- Any Nipple Discharge - Particularly Clear Discharge Or Bloody Discharge
  - It is also important to note that a milky discharge that is present when a woman is not breastfeeding should be checked by her doctor, although it is not linked with breast cancer.
  - Let your doctor know about any nipple discharge, clear, bloody or milky. The most concerning discharges are bloody or clear.

## Benign Tumors
When a tumor is diagnosed as benign, doctors will usually leave it alone rather than remove it. Even though these tumors are not generally aggressive toward surrounding tissue, occasionally they may continue to grow, pressing on other tissue and causing pain or other problems. In these situations, the tumor is removed, allowing pain or complications to subside.

## Malignant tumors
Malignant tumors are cancerous and may be aggressive because they invade and damage surrounding tissue. When a tumor is suspected to be malignant, the doctor will perform a biopsy to determine the severity or aggressiveness of the tumor.

## Adipose Tissue
The female breast is mostly made up of a collection of fat cells called adipose tissue. This tissue extends from the collarbone down to the underarm and across to the middle of the ribcage. As a woman ages, especially once she reaches menopause, the breast tissue contains more adipose (fatty) tissue.

## Lobes, Lobules, And Milk Ducts
A healthy female breast is made up of 12–20 sections called lobes. Each of these lobes is made up of many smaller lobules, the gland that produces milk in nursing women. Both the lobes and lobules are connected by milk ducts, which act as stems or tubes to carry the milk to the nipple. These breast structures are generally where the cancer begins to form.
